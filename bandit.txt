bandit1 - boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1 (`ls` command there is a file called readme open via using `cat readme`)
bandit2 - CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9 (`ls` command there is a file called -, these used for argument in linux command so these are open via using `cat ./-`)

you can play around with find command first it takes time to work 

bandit6 - DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7 (`ls` command there is a directory called inhere and after `cd inhere` there is multiple directory, now we need to extract one file which is not executable 1033 bytes and readble so we use find command like `find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable` it return only one result which is readble but very long file we can see its content using `head .filexx`)
bandit7 - HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs (find a file using given condition like `find -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c` it give multiple permission denied msg but one of the file isn't and that's the file you can see using `cat path_of_file`)
bandit8 - cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV (`ls` command give a file data.txt which is a long file, now according to suggestion we use command `grep` like `cat data.txt | grep millionth`)
bandit9 - UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR (`ls` command give a file data.txt which is a long file, now according to suggestion we first use sort command with `cat data.txt | sort` to sort the sequence now in the same command we use uniq command to extract the unique line, full command like `cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u`)
bandit10 - truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk (`ls` command give a file data.txt which is a long file, now according to suggestion we use strings command to print human readable text from this file and use grep command for extraact password with several '='charecter, our command like `strings data.txt | grep '='`)
bandit11 - IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR (`ls` command give a file data.txt which is a long file, now according to suggestion this is a base64 encode text now we can decrypt this text using `cat data.txt | base64 -d` command)
bandit12 - 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu (here in data.txt file uses ROT13 encoding where each charecter is replaced via the next 13th charecter in sequence, now we can use `tr` command to translate to orignal form like this `cat data.txt | tr '[a-zA-Z]' '[n-za-mN-ZA-M]'`)
